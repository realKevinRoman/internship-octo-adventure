Dear Year Up recruiting team,
I am writing to inquire about an internship opportunity I saw on Indeed.com for Information Technology. I am a high school senior nearing graduation in June and I begin studying computer science at the City College of New York in the fall.
In high school I was a part of my schoolâ€™s tech team where we maintained all of the computers, laptops, sound systems, internet servers, and much more. I am continuing to expand my knowledge of computers by currently studying for the CompTIA A+ certification exam, along with goals of pursuing N+, Security+, and CISSP certification within a year.  
I know that with this internship I will be a great asset to whichever corporate partner I am assigned to. I am excited to participate in this internship as it has been my desire to be involved in the tech world since a very young age. Influence from my brother, who is a software engineer at Honeywell, has driven me to seek opportunities in the tech world. Information technology will be my first step into achieving my goal of becoming a cyber security analyst.
I would like the opportunity to intern for Year Up and it would be wonderful if we could schedule a visit. Please let me know if you require any additional information. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
Kevin Roman
